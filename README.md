This is a first attempt at a front-end for a hypothetical Benefit Rewards network, using tokens on Bitcoin (BSV). Simple HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The idea is that you connect ethical small business together through this rewards program and allow them to take advantage of economies of scale not available to their less ethical competitors.

Tokens on this rewards network are essentially gift cards, that are linked to the total profits of the network. This is done with a 'halving' approach, where the rate of token issuance (tokens/$ spent) will be higher early, and will half every time period. This encourages a flood of customers to the network.
